# QA Python Assessment Example

This is an example question for the QA Python assessment to get you familiar with the assessment process.

In order to complete the assessment, you must do the following:

- Fork the repository to make a version under your own GitHub account.
- Clone your forked repository (NOT the original repo!).

You can run `pytest` to test your answer (make sure your repository is your current working directory):

```bash
python -m pytest
```

If the above command does not work, make sure `pytest` is installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

If the unit test passes, you have answered the question correctly.

When you complete the question, commit your answer with the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "completed example question"
```

Then, push up your answers to GitHub with:

```bash
git push origin main
```
